# Netlify Algolia Index Plugin [Deprecated]

This package has been deprecated and archived with the release of my replacement package.

## Demo

- Demo site: https://netlify-plugins-by-lukeocodes.netlify.app

## Usage

To install, add the plugin in your `netlify.toml` or use the Netlify plugin directory. No config is required but we show the default options below.

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-algolia-index"
```

## Options

The available options.

| plugins.inputs  | type  | required  | default  | description  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| exclude | Array | false | `[]` | An array of paths to exclude from the build. e.g. `['/admin', '/404.html']` |
| indexName | String | false | `searchIndex.json` | The name of the file to be saved to. You'll need to configure your metadata to point to this file. |
| textLength | Number | false | `7000` | The length the body of the page content will be truncated to. This is due to indexing limitations on community versions of Algolia, which we assume is the default. |
| stopwords | Array | false | `[]` | Additional stopwords. @see [stopword](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/stopword) |

## Examples

### Exclude files

Your project probably contains some content files that you don't want your users to search. Pass an array of paths (or regex) to the files you donâ€™t want to be indexed.

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-algolia-index"
    [plugins.inputs]
      exclude = ['''^\/admin.*''', '''^\/search.*''', '/404.html']
```

### Exclude Everything BUT Blog Posts

Advanced Regex Alert! This will exclude all files that DON'T match the regex for URLs like `/blog/(year)/(month)/(day)/(slug)/index.html`.

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-algolia-index"
    [plugins.inputs]
      exclude = ['''^\/(?!blog\/[0-9]{4}\/[0-9]{2}\/[0-9]{2}\/(?!index.html)).*''']
```

## Credit

Based on the [Netlify Search Index Plugin](https://github.com/sw-yx/netlify-plugin-search-index) by [swyx](https://github.com/sw-yx) for fetching and parsing the content into something we can index.
